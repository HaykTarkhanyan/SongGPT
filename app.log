Life is a waterfall,
we're one in the river,
and one again after the fall.

Swimming through the void
we hear the word,
we lose ourselves,
but we find it all.

'Cause we are the ones that want to play,
always want to go,
but you never want to stay.

And we are the ones that want to choose,
always want to play,
but you never want to lose.

Aerials, in the sky,
when you lose small mind,
you free your life.

Aerials, so up high,
when you free your eyes,
eternal prize.

\u0565\u057d\u056b\u0574
Armenians, we are one,
with \u0568\u0576\u056f\u0565\u0580\u0576\u0565\u0580, with our ton,
\u0565\u057d\u056b\u0574 \u0587 \u0564\u0578\u0582, damn, it's fun.

Laughing through the day
we hear the jokes,
we lose ourselves in the may.

'Cause we are the ones who love to joke,
always want to laugh,
but sometimes we just choke.

And we are the ones who love to feast,
always want to eat,
but sometimes we get obese.

\u0565\u057d\u056b\u0574, \u0561\u0580\u0587
when we make each other giggle,
our hearts don't feel bereave.

\u0565\u057d\u056b\u0574, a good way to live,
just keep on laughing,
and happiness shall receive.

Original lyrics: 
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see 'em again till the fourth of July

Changed lyrics:
Where do coders go when they code?
They don't go to heaven where the servers are stowed
They go deep into Python mode
Won't see 'em till their code's bestowed

Original lyrics:
People cry, and people moan
Look for a dry place to call their home
Try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils try to make 'em their own

Changed lyrics:
People crash and people debug
Look for a code to be their plug
Try to write some code to make it bug
While the users and the testers try to give it a shrug

Original lyrics:
If you gotta go, go with a smile
'Cause it's only gonna be for a little while
And know that you're gonna be remembered
For the things that you say and do

Changed lyrics: 
If you gotta code, code with a smile
'Cause someday it'll be worth a pile
And know that you're gonna be remembered
For the algorithms and the modules you delivered

Original lyrics:
People say I'm no good
And crazy as a loon
'Cause I get stoned in the morning
And get drunk in the afternoon

Changed lyrics:
People say Python's no good
It has a syntax which they've never understood
But I get happy in the morning
And get dazed with updates till noon.
